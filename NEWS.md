# overshiny 0.2.0

* Simplified use of overlay dropdown menus. This now works in a different way
than it did before, so this is a breaking change. See the documentation for
`overlayServer()` and the vignettes for details.
* Introduced a new function, `snapGrid()`, to handle the more obvious use case
  for the `snap` argument to `overlayServer()`.
* Added `rangeHeading()` and `dateHeading()` for dropdown menu headings.
* Added a new vignette on infectious disease modelling with overlays.

# overshiny 0.1.1

* `useOverlay()` is now called automatically if you use `overlayPlotOutput()`.
* Added `remargin()` function for adjusting ggplot2 plot margins.
* Expanded the introductory vignette.

# overshiny 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
